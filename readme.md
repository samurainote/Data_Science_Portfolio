# Data Science Portfolio
This Repository contains following 3 kinds of projects what I have done as a self-taught NLP / Machine Learning Engineer.
1. 100% Handmade Personal Projects
2. Workflow and Topic based contents which describe about Regularization or Optimization for Gradient Dicent
3. Mini Projects which I followed tutorials mostly from Medium and Kaggle, Machine Learning Mystery

I'm writer of "#ShortcutML" on Medium.com and writing about machine learning and Data Science. check out [medium.com](https://medium.com/@akiratakezawa)
I also have my personal portfolio website, check out [resume.com](https://www.resume.id/samurainote/works)
